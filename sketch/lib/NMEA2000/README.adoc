= NMEA2000 library for C++ =

Object oriented NMEA2000 library for Teensy, ESP, Arduino, MBED and Rasberry type Boards.
These board types has been tested, but library can be used also in other systems by writing
compatible CAN driver and wrapper for other hw specific functions.

Library gives you easy way to make different kind of NMEA2000 bus devices like
sensor transducers (battery, temperature, wind, engine, etc.), NMEA2000 information displays,
NMEA2000->PC interface (like Actisense NGT1), NMEA0183->NMEA2000 or NMEA2000->NMEA0183 converter.

Library fulfills NMEA 2000 mandatory functions and behaviour. Devices using library can pass NMEA2000
certification tests. Library has been used in several commercial certified products.
