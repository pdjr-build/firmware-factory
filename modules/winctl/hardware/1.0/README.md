# MODCTL v1.0

This prototype module design includes a [circuit schematic](schematic.pdf),
[pcb layout](pcb.pdf) and [enclosure proposal](enclosure.pdf) and firmware
for an NMEA 2000 compatible spudpole control interface built around a Teensy
3.2 MCU.

The design has the following key features.

* Power supplied by the NMEA 2000 bus (LEN = 1).
* Support for operation of one or two remote windlasses.
* Separate UP and DOWN input channels for each windlass.
* Separate UP and DOWN zero-volt operating status outputs for each windlass.
* Zero-volt module power status output with NMEA active indication.
* NMEA bus connection by standard M12 5-pin connector.
* Assocation with remote windlass by hardware address configuration.
* Multiple status/diagnostic indicator LEDs.

## Enclosure proposal

The protoype PCB design is configured for an 80x80x23 flanged ABS
[enclosure](https://docs.rs-online.com/960c/0900766b814af9a1.pdf)
with grommeted cable entry for input and output cables and an industry
standard M12 5-pin industrial connector for NMEA/CAN connection.
The enclosure is drilled to expose PCB mounted status LEDs.

### Power supply

The module is powered at 5VDC by the output of a DC-DC converter which is
connected directly to the S and C connections of the host NMEA bus. Typically
this will be operating at 12VD, but the module will accept bus voltages in the
range 9VDC through 36VDC.

The module draws approximately 150mA from the bus power supply giving an
NMEA LEN of 3. The NMEA bus is protected by a self-resetting 1A polyfuse.

### CAN interface

The NMEA/CAN data interface is implemented using an MCP2551 industry standard
transceiver. The transciver power input is decoupled by a tantalum capacitor.
The CAN H and L signals are fed directly to the transceiver inputs, but the
circuit board has provision for adding components for RC input filtering should
this prove necessary.

### Sensor inputs 

Four otically isolated sensor inputs rated at 12/24VDC allow connection
of MOTOR-RETRIEVING, MOTOR-DEPLOYING, DOCKED and DEPLOYED sensors and a
5VDC powered interface supports connection of an induction proximity
sensor for use as a windlass rotation counter.

The module is able to directly control a windlass motor through UP and
DOWN relay outputs which are driven by control messages received over
the host NMEA bus.

An installer can quickly assign the module an instance address using a
DIP swith and LED indicators show relay state, power and data
transmission status. 

## Inputs

The INSTANCE dip switch allows setting of the module's NMEA instance address.

* INSTANCE(1): Address bit 0
* INSTANCE(2): Address bit 1
* INSTANCE(3): Address bit 2
* INSTANCE(4): Address bit 3
* INSTANCE(5): Address bit 4
* INSTANCE(6): Address bit 5
* INSTANCE(7): Address bit 6
* INSTANCE(8): Address bit 7

The SENSOR connector supports connection of a simple proximity sensor for
counting winch spool rotations.

* SENSOR(1): GND
* SENSOR(2): +5VDC
* SENSOR(3): Sensor input

The LIMIT connector supports opto-isolated connection of 12/24VDC signals from
existing spudpole sensors.

* LIMIT(1): Docked / Stopped sensor GND
* LIMIT(2): Docked sensor +ve
* LIMIT(3): Stopped sensor +ve

## Outputs

The module generates two outputs via isolated relays on the RELAY connector:

* RELAY(1): DOWN relay common
* RELAY(2): DOWN relay switched
* RELAY(3): UP relay common
* RELAY(4): UP relay switched
